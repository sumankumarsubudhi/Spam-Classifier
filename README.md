# Spam-Classifier
It is the design of a machine learning model that can efficiently predict if an SMS message is spam or not!

Spam detection is one of the major applications of Machine Learning in the interwebs today. Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built in and automatically classify such mail as 'Junk Mail'.
Being able to identify spam messages is a binary classification problem as messages are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' and nothing else. Also, this is a supervised learning problem, as we will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions.
